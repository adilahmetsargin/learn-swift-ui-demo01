SwiftUI essentials

Creating and combining views
This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. 
You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. 
To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. 

Building lists and navigation
With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and to view the details about each location.

You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark.
