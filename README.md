SwiftUI essentials

-Creating and combining views
This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. 
You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. 
To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. 

-Building lists and navigation
With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and to view the details about each location.

You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark.

-Handling user input
In the Landmarks app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.

-Drawing paths and shapes
Users receive a badge whenever they visit a landmark in their list. Of course, for a user to receive a badge, you’ll need to create one. This tutorial takes you through the process of creating a badge by combining paths and shapes, which you then overlay with another shape that represents the location.

If you want to create multiple badges for different kinds of landmarks, try experimenting with the overlaid symbol, varying the amount of repetition, or changing the various angles and scales.

-Animating views and transitions
When using SwiftUI, you can individually animate changes to views, or to a view’s state, no matter where the effects are. SwiftUI handles all the complexity of these combined, overlapping, and interruptible animations for you.

In this tutorial, you’ll animate a view that contains a graph for tracking the hikes a user takes while using the Landmarks app. Using the animation(_:) modifier, you’ll see just how easy it is to animate a view.

-Composing complex interfaces
The category view for Landmarks shows a vertically scrolling list of horizontally scrolling landmarks. As you build this view and connect it to your existing views, you’ll explore how composed views can adapt to different device sizes and orientations.

-App design and layout
Working with UI controls
In the Landmarks app, users can create a profile to express their personality. To give users the ability to change their profile, you’ll add an edit mode and design the preferences screen.

You’ll work with a variety of common user interface controls for data entry, and update the Landmarks model types whenever the user saves their changes.
